# Donations

CyTube (https://cytu.be) is provided as a free service, with no advertisements,
premium memberships, or sponsorship.  I develop and maintain the server as a
hobby, and pay the bills out of pocket.  Currently CyTube's main server costs
$20.00/month (minus donations); I expect this to increase in the future as it
grows bigger.

I accept donations via PayPal and Bitcoin to help cover the costs of server
hosting.  Donating is by no means a requirement, but I do appreciate your help
in keeping the website up.

I appreciate the continued support of past donors who have kept server costs as
a non-issue for me to continue running the service.  If you've donated before,
feel free to email me the transaction ID and I'll be happy to recognize you on
this page for donating.
