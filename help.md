# Help

Common problems and questions can usually be answered by consulting the
[FAQ](https://github.com/calzoneman/sync/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) or the
[user guide](https://github.com/calzoneman/sync/blob/3.0/docs/index.md).

### IRC Support

Live support for CyTube is available on
[6IRC](https://webchat.6irc.net/?channels=cytube).  You can use the previous
link, or connect your own IRC client to `irc.6irc.net` and join `#cytube`.  IRC
support is offered on a best-effort basis; you may not get an immediate
response.  People are typically available to answer questions during USA daytime
hours.  If you don't get a response after 15 minutes, it probably means no one
is available.

### Email Support

I also provide support via [email](mailto:cyzon@cytu.be).  I aim to respond to
emails within 24 hours.  You can also email [nuclearace](mailto:nuclearace@cytu.be) if
I'm not available.

### Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Please submit bug reports and feature requests to the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/calzoneman/sync/issues).

**When submitting a bug report:**

  * If the issue is a critical exploit (e.g., an exploit that allows you to
    crash the service or bypass security measures), please send me an email
    instead of reporting the issue publicly
  * Include a detailed description of the problem
  * If possible, explain how to reproduce the problem
  * Ensure that you've tried the following before submitting the report
    - Clear your cache and cookies and try again
    - Disable all browser extensions and try again
    - Try a different browser

**When submitting a feature request**

  * Search the issue tracker to check if it has been requested previously
  * Include a description of the feature and explain why it is useful
  * When relevant, include a mock up (doesn't have to be fancy, just a simple
    drawing will do)
