## Costs

Servers are currently hosted with [RamNode](http://ramnode.com/).  At one point,
an application server was hosted with [BuyVM](https://buyvm.net/), but was moved
due to continual networking problems.

  * Webserver / application server (cytu.be) &mdash; 2GB SVZ (RamNode) in
    Seattle with DDoS protection &mdash; $20/month
  * Application server (lax1.cytu.be) &mdash; 1GB SKVMS (RamNode) in Los Angeles
    &mdash; $9/month
  * Application server (liberty.cytu.be) &mdash; 1GB SKVM (RamNode) in NYC with
    DDoS protection &mdash; $12.60/month
  * Database server (internal) &mdash; 512MB SKVM (RamNode) in Seattle &mdash;
    $6.30/month

**Total:** $47.90/month ($574.80/year).

I'm aiming to reduce costs in the future by replacing the webserver with a
cheaper server and potentially scaling on demand instead of always having 3
application servers.  Donations to help pay for the servers are accepted via
Bitcoin and PayPal (see the footer of https://cytu.be).
